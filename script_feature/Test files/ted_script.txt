          As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to\
          slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States.\
          The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through\
          the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see\
          large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's\
          winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one\
          small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear\
          the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.\

\f1\b0 \cf2            It has been said that magic vanished from\
           our world a long time ago. And that\
           humanity can no longer fulfill its\
           desires through the power of wishes.\
           To those who have lost the wondrous\
           vision of childhood eyes, submitted here\
           is the story of a little boy, and a\
           magical Christmas wish that changed his\
           life forever.\

          his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for\
          the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is\
          ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple\
          stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's\
          evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's\
          been around for three decades. He and John, who sits\
          next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.\
          John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-\
          worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a\
          box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,\
          he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the\
          remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity\
          Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,\
          though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that\
          this is a guy who has never really given up his\
          childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted\
          passes the bong to John.\

          We see Lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of\
          dancing clubgoers. Nearby, we see John dancing with a\
          girl, and doing it very badly. He's putting too much\
          into it, obviously trying to impress her. The girl is\
          gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the\
          moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move,\
          accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force\
          to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts\
          to this, we see that it is Lori. She starts to get up,\
          when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet.\

          chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted\

          lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,\
          and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out\
          of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord\
          catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from\
          John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and\
          cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,\
          whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the\

          clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He\

          clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,\
          yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his\
          bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks\

          Ted is still on the floor on the passenger's seat side.\
          He looks around, and spots a "Club" underneath the seat.\
          He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted\
          grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing\
          at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap\
          Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few\
          of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted\
          away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then,\
          with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in\
          front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering\
          wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles\
          into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but\
          can't.\

          Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the\
          street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it\
          impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop.\
          Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the\
          back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of\
          glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles\
          for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit.\
          TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly.\

          out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase\

          metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs\
          on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his\
          larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him\

          past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He\
          has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted\
          scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto\

          a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't\
